Party people
Party people
Can y'all get funky?
Soul Sonic Force - can y'll get funky?
The Zulu Nation - can y'll get funky?
Yaaah!
Just hit me
Just taste the funk and hit me
Just get on down and hit me
Bambaataa's gettin' so funky, now, hit me
Yaaah!
Just hit me

It's time to chase your dreams
Up out ya seats, make your body sway
Socialize, get down, let your soul lead the way
Shake it now, go ladies, it's a livin' dream
Love Life Live
Come play the game, our world is free
Do what you want but scream

We know a place where the nights are hot
It is a house of funk
Females and males
Both young and old, called the disco
