Party people, party people, can y'all get funky?
Soul Sonic Force, can y'll get funky?
The Zulu Nation, can y'll get funky?
Yah, just hit me
Just taste the funk and hit me
Just get on down and hit me
Bambaataa's jus' gettin' so funky, now, hit me
Yah, just hit me
Just start to chase your dreams
Up out your seats, make your body sway
Socialize, get down, let your soul lead the way
Shake it now, go ladies, it's a livin' dream, love, life, live
Come play the game, our world is free
Do what you want but scream
We know a place where the nights are hot
It is a house of funk, females and males
Both headed all for the disco
The DJ plays your favorite blasts
Takes you back to the past, music's magic, poof
Bump, bump, bump, get bump with some flash, people
Rock, rock, to the Planet Rock, don't stop
Rock, rock, to the Planet Rock, don't stop
The Soul Sonic Force, Mr. Biggs
Pow Wow and MC Globe
We emphasize the show, we got ego
Make this your night, just slip it right and by day
As the people say, live it up, shucks
No work or play, our world is free
Be what you be, be
Rock, rock, to the Planet Rock, don't stop
Rock, rock, to the Planet Rock, don't stop
You're in a place where the nights are hot
Where nature's children dance and set a chance
On this Mother Earth, which is our rock
The time has come, and work for soul
Show you really got soul, are you ready?
Hump, bump, bump, get bump, now let's go, house
Twist and turn, the you let your body slide
You got the body rock and pop, bounce and pounce
Everybody just rock it, don't stop it
Gotta rock it, don't stop
Keep tickin' and tockin',
Work it all around the clock
Everybody keep rockin' and clockin'
And shockin' and rockin', go house
Everybody say, rock it, don't stop it
(Rock it, don't stop it)
Well hit me, Mr. Biggs

You gotta rock it, pop it, 'cuz it's the century
There is such a place that creates such a melody
Our world is but a land of a master jam, get up and dance

Up out your seats, make your body sway
